# Exposed Credentials

## Desc:  
```
We captured some network traffic of some chemistry fan. Give us his username and password so we can login to the same server. We don't know at all how to use this thing/software called "wireshark". Thanks a lot.

Flag Format: ACSI{username_password}

Eg. if the username is "foo" and the password is "bar", the flag is ACSI{foo_bar}
